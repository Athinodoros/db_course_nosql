    "# What is a Graph?\n",

    "\n",
    "## Undirected Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A *graph* $G$ consists of a nonempty set, $V(G)$, called the *vertices* of $G$, and a set $E(G)$ called the *edges* of $G$. An element of $V(G)$ is called a *vertex*. A vertex is also called a *node*; the words \"vertex\" and \"node\" are used interchangeably. An element of $E(G)$ is an *undirected* edge or simply an \"edge\". An undirected edge has two vertices $u\\neq v$ called its endpoints. Such an edge can be represented by the two element set $\\{u, v\\}$. The notation $\\langle u—v \\rangle$ denotes this edge.\n",
    "Both $\\langle u—v \\rangle$ and $\\langle v—u \\rangle$ define the same undirected edge, whose endpoints are $u$ and $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/graph_example_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let $H$ be the graph pictured in Figure above. The vertices of $H$\n",
    "correspond to the nine dots, that is, $V(H) = \\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The edges correspond to the eight lines, that is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(H) = \\big\\{\\langle a—b \\rangle,\\langle a—c \\rangle,\\langle b—d \\rangle,\\langle c—d \\rangle,\\langle c—e \\rangle,\\langle e—f \\rangle,\\langle e—g \\rangle,\\langle h—i \\rangle\\big\\} $\n",

    "## Directed Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A *directed graph* -or *digraph*- $G$ consists of a nonempty set $V(G)$, called the vertices of $G$, and a set $E(G)$, called the edges of $G$. An element of $V(G)$ is called a *vertex*. A vertex is also called a *node*; the words \"vertex\" and \"node\" are used interchangeably. An element of $E(G)$ is called a *directed edge*. A directed edge is also called an \"arrow\" or simply an \"edge\". A directed edge starts at some vertex $u$ called the *tail* of the edge, and ends at some vertex $v$ called the *head* of the edge.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertex Degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "The *in-degree* of a vertex in a digraph is the number of arrows coming into it, and similarly its *out-degree* is the number of arrows out of it. More precisely,\n",
    "\n",
    "If $G$ is a *digraph* and $v \\in V(G)$, then \n",
    "    \n",
    "  * $indeg(v) ::= \\big\\vert e \\in \\{E(G)\\, \\vert\\, head(e) = v \\}\\big\\vert$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walks and Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Picturing digraphs with points and arrows makes it natural to talk about following successive edges through the graph. For example, in the digraph above, you might start at vertex 1, successively follow the edges from vertex `a` to vertex `b`, from `b` to `c`, from `c` to `b`, and then from `b` to `d`. The sequence of edges followed in this way is called a *walk* through the graph. A *path* is a *walk* which never visits a vertex more than once. So following edges from `a` to `b` to `c` is a path, but it stops being a path if you go to `b` again.\n",
    "The natural way to represent a walk is with the sequence of sucessive vertices it went through, in this case: \n",
    "\n",
    "$a\\,b\\,c\\,b\\,d$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is conventional to represent a walk by an alternating sequence of successive vertices and edges, so this walk would formally be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$a\\, \\langle a\\rightarrow b \\rangle \\,b\\, \\langle b\\rightarrow c \\rangle \\,c\\, \\langle c\\rightarrow \\,b\\, \\rangle \\,b\\, \\langle b\\rightarrow d \\rangle\\, d$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The redundancy of this definition is enough to make any computer scientist cringe, but it does make it easy to talk about how many times vertices and edges occur on the walk. Here is a formal definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A *walk* in a digraph is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges that begins with a vertex, ends with a vertex, and such that for every edge $\\langle u\\rightarrow v \\rangle$ in the walk, vertex $u$ is the element just before the edge, and vertex $v$ is the next element after the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So a walk $w$ is a sequence of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$w ::= v_{0}\\, \\langle v_{0}\\rightarrow v_{1} \\rangle \\,v_{1}\\, \\langle v_{1}\\rightarrow v_{2} \\rangle \\,v_{2}\\, ... \\langle v_{k-1}\\rightarrow \\,v_{k}\\, \\rangle \\,v_{k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\langle v_{i}\\rightarrow \\,v_{i+1}\\, \\rangle \\in E(G)$ for $i \\in [0..k)$ The walk is said to start at $v_{0}$, to end at $v_{k}$, and the length $\\vert v\\vert$ of the walk is defined to be k.\n",
    "The walk is a path if and only if all the $v_{i}$’s are different,that is,if $i \\neq j$, then $v_{i} \\neq v_{j}$.\n",
    "A *closed* walk is a walk that begins and ends at the same vertex. A cycle is a positive length closed walk whose vertices are distinct except for the beginning and end vertices.\n",

    "# Intro to Cypher\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cypher* is Neo4j's graph query language. It is purpose built for working with graph data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes it easy to work with graphs as it uses:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * patterns to describe graph data\n",
    "  * familiar SQL-like clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cypher* is a declarative language. That is, your patterns describe **what** to find, not **how** to find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use Cypher to generate a small social graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "CREATE (a:Person { name: \"Emil\", from: \"Sweden\", klout: 99 })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is it. The `CREATE` clause cossesponds to you drawing a circle on the whiteboard. You use it to create data, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `()` parenthesis indicate a node\n",
    "  * `a:Person` a variable `a` and label `Person` for the new node\n",
    "  * `{}` brackets add properties to the node\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Finding nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the node representing Emil:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a:Person) \n",
    "WHERE a.name = \"Emil\" \n",
    "RETURN a;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MATCH` clause specifies a pattern of nodes and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `(a:Person)` a single node pattern with label 'Person' which will assign matches to the variable 'a'\n",
    "  * `WHERE` clause to constrain the results\n",
    "  * `a.name = \"Emil\"` compares name property to the value `\"Emil\"`\n",
    "  * `RETURN` clause used to request particular results\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "To find all nodes in your database you would relax your query and just search for example for all nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a) \n",
    "RETURN a;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a) \n",
    "RETURN count(*);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create More Nodes and Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "CREATE (js:Person { name: \"Johan\", from: \"Sweden\", learn: \"surfing\" })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a) \n",
    "RETURN a;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating two nodes -one for Emil and one for Johan respectively- manually, we have two disconnected nodes in the dataset. You could add a `KNOWS` relationship between them by matching the nodes and creating a new relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a),(b)\n",
    "WHERE a.name = \"Emil\" AND b.name = \"Johan\"\n",
    "CREATE (a)-[:KNOWS {since: 2001}]->(b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the `CREATE` clause can create many nodes and relationships at once too.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a:Person),(b:Person) \n",
    "WHERE a.name = \"Emil\" AND b.name = \"Johan\"\n",

    "(a)-[:KNOWS {rating: 5}]->(ir),(b)-[:KNOWS]->(ir),(b)-[:KNOWS]->(rvb),\n",
    "(ir)-[:KNOWS]->(b),(ir)-[:KNOWS]->(ally),(rvb)-[:KNOWS]->(ally)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns -think of them as ASCII art representation of patterns in the graph- describe *what* to find in the graph. For instance, a pattern can be used to find Emil's friends:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(friends)\n",
    "WHERE a.name = \"Emil\" \n",
    "RETURN a, friends\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `MATCH` clause to describe the pattern from known Nodes to found Nodes\n",
    "  * `(a)` starts the pattern with a Person (qualified by WHERE)\n",
    "  * `-[:KNOWS]-` matches `KNOWS` relationships (in either direction)\n",
    "  * (friends)will be bound to Emil's friends\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many friends does Emil have?\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(friends)\n",
    "WHERE a.name = \"Emil\" \n",
    "RETURN count(friends)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Using patterns and pattern matching we can quickly generate recommendations. For example, Johan is learning to surf, so he may want to find a new friend who already does:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]-()-[:KNOWS]-(surfer)\n",
    "WHERE a.name = \"Johan\" AND surfer.hobby = \"surfing\"\n",
    "RETURN DISTINCT surfer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `()` empty parenthesis to ignore these nodes\n",
    "  * `DISTINCT` because more than one path will match the pattern\n",
    "  * `surfer` will contain Allison, a friend of a friend who surfs\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Deleting Nodes and Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can delete nodes with the help of the `DELETE` directive.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (a)\n",
    "DELETE a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you cannot delete nodes, which are still connected with relations. That will result in an error message similar to theh following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cannot delete node<512>, because it still has relationships. To delete this node, you must first delete its relationships.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
