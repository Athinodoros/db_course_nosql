    "# Importing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to follow the introduction on how to import data from CSV files into a Neo4J database you can follow the tutorial in this repository, by running `:play http://127.0.0.1:8001/social_network.html` in the web client of the database in your VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Using Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "> A database index is a redundant copy of information in the database for the purpose of making retrieving said data more efficient. This comes at the cost of additional storage space and slower writes, so deciding what to index and what not to index is an important and often non-trivial task.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Cypher allows the creation of indexes over a property for all nodes that have a given label. Once an index has been created, it will automatically be managed and kept up to date by the database whenever the graph is changed. Neo4j will automatically pick up and start using the index once it has been created and brought online. http://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/schema/index/\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an index on certain attributes as in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "CREATE INDEX ON :Person(name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually you do not need to specify which indexes to use in a query. When indexes exist, they will be used in `WHERE` clauses for comparison operations, including equality, inequality, `IN`, `STARTS WITH`, `has`, `exists`, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you want to get rid of an index, run:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Importing Data from a CSV File in Cypher\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are going to import our data from CSV files via Cypher.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## `LOAD CSV`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`LOADCSV` is used to import data from CSV files. The URL of the CSV file is specified by using `FROM` followed by an arbitrary expression evaluating to the URL in question.\n",
    "It is required to specify a variable for the CSV data using `AS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LOAD CSV` supports resources compressed with gzip, Deflate, as well as ZIP archives.\n",
    "CSV files can be stored on the database server and are then accessible using a `file:///` URL. Alternatively, `LOAD CSV` also supports accessing CSV files via HTTPS, HTTP, and FTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "USING PERIODIC COMMIT\n",
    "LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM \"file:///social_network_nodes.csv\" AS row\n",
    "MERGE (:Person {id: toInt(row.node_id), name: row.name, job: row.job, birthday: row.birthday});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "USING PERIODIC COMMIT 5000\n",
    "LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM \"file:///social_network_edges.csv\" AS row                   \n",
    "MATCH (f:Person {id: toInt(row.source_node_id)}), (t:Person {id: toInt(row.target_node_id)})                            \n",
    "CREATE (f)-[:ENDORSES]->(t);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the CSV file contains a significant number of rows, i.e., hundreds of thousands or millions, `USING PERIODIC COMMIT` can be used to instruct Neo4j to perform a commit after a number of rows. This reduces the memory overhead of the transaction state. By default, the commit will happen every 1000 rows. For your exercises it is a good idea to rely `USING PERIODIC COMMIT` as the VM does not provide a lot of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `MERGE`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MERGE` clause ensures that a pattern exists in the graph. Either the pattern already exists, or it needs to be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "`MERGE` either matches existing nodes and binds them, or it creates new data and binds that. It is like a combination of `MATCH` and `CREATE` that additionally allows you to specify what happens if the data was matched or created.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can specify that the graph must contain a node for a user with a certain name. If there is not a node with the correct name, a new node will be created and its name property set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Importing Data from the Command-line\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can import data directly from the command-line with help of the `neo4j-import` tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool, creates a new database from a collection of CSV files, which you would typically do for an initial data import.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this will not work on the VM as it does not have sufficient memory. On a real database server this will work.\n",
